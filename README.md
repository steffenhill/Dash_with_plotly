Food Consumption Characteristics of the European Union Interactive Visualization Report - Data Visualization 2021 - Group Project 2

Introduction
There has been a number of forces that has been driving changes in global food consumption. In the past decades, consumers have shifted to more lavish forms of nutrients. This is mostly due to the increasing food consumption power among most customers in the world. Despite the relationship of the buyers purchasing power and certain food consumption patterns, the interrelationships between the climate and geographical location of a country and its food consumption characteristics has been a thought-provoking subject to explore. More importantly, the consumption patterns are highly correlated with the overall health issues, such as obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular diseases which ultimately play a major part in determining life expectancy.
The present project intends to take a closer look at the similarities and dissimilarities in regard to food consumption and health issues among countries within the European Union which could function as a cornerstone to further studies.

Dataset Description
The main dataset used originates from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [1] which entails the data concerning the food supply in kilograms per capita per year for 179 countries. Yet this project aspires to explore countries within the European Union for the sake of a narrower scope of research as well as preventing incomplete information within the dataset. Furthermore, information regarding life expectancy, health expenditure, GDP, diabetes diseases and obesity per country have been obtained from Our World in Data [2], Opendatasoft [3] as well as Eurostat [4].

Visualization and Interaction Choices
The present dashboard intends to maximize the number of available interactions and options for the user. In total there are six visualizations with all of them allowing interaction with the user.
